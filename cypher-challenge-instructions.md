# Cipher Challenge

Once getting into teams, students will decide on a sentence containing a “fruit”
"Bananas are a mid-tier fruit" 

The team will then encrypt the fruit in their sentence using the Atbash Cipher
"Yzmzmzh are a mid-tier fruit"

|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

|Z|Y|X|W|V|U|T|S|R|Q|P|O|N|M|L|K|J|I|H|G|F|E|D|C|B|A|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|


Teams will then encrypt their own unique KEY using the Affine #1 Cipher
- Example Key: CYBER
- Affine Cypher Process: CYBER > 2, 24, 1, 4, 17
- +5 to all numbers > 7, 3 (24+5=29, 29-26=3), 6, 9, 22
- Encrypted Key: HDGJW

|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|2|2|2|2|2|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| | | | | | | | | | |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|)|1|2|3|4|5|

Teams will use that KEY to encrypt their complete sentence using the Mono-Alphabet Cipher #2

Example with Cyber Key:

|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

|C|Y|B|E|R|A|D|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|S|T|U|V|W|Y|Z|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|


"Yzmzmzh are a mid-tier fruit" becomes…
“Xzkzkzf cpr c kge-sgrp aptgs”

Teams can give their encrypted key and complete sentence to other groups to crack to discover what fruit the other groups selected and what the entire sentence contains.

Encrypted Key: HDGJW
Encrypted Sentence: “Xzkzkzf cpr c kge-sgrp aptgs”
